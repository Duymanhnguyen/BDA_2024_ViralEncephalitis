"50","20558","Slfn4","schlafen 4","11","11 50.3 cM","Mus musculus","house mouse","The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Schlafen family. All members of this family contain a Schlafen box domain that lies near an AAA domain. This protein belongs to the group 2 subset of Schlafen proteins, which are defined by a molecular weight between 58 kDa and 68 kDa and by the presence of a SWADL domain that contains the sequence Ser-Trp-Ala-Asp-Leu. In malignant melanoma cells, gene expression is up-regulated in response to interferon alpha. In bone marrow-derived macrophages, expression of this gene is induced during activation by Toll-like receptor agonists and repressed during macrophage colony-stimulating factor-mediated differentiation. Myelopoiesis is disrupted by constitutive overexpression in myeloid-lineage cells. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 11. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
